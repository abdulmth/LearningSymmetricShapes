# Learning Symmetric Shapes
This project is based on the workshop paper ["Learning to Reconstruct Symmetric Shapes using Planar Parameterization of 3D Surface"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335528865_Learning_to_Reconstruct_Symmetric_Shapes_using_Planar_Parameterization_of_3D_Surface). First part of this project deals with parameterization and second deals with learning of shapes from geometry images.

## Installation
Code for Parameterization has been written in C++ and requires:
- CGAL [Fork with Iterative Parameterization Implementation](https://github.com/hrdkjain/cgal/tree/Iterative_authalic_parameterization)
- Boost
- OpenCV

Deep network code is based on Tensorflow and is tested on Ubuntu with:
- python (3.5.2)
- tensorflow-gpu (1.14)
- scikit-image (0.15.0)
- numpy (1.16.5)
- natsort
- tqdm

## Usage
### Part I: Parameterization
Code contains functionality for:
- slicing the mesh (--slice)
- Iterative Surface Parameterization with **_n_** iterations (--sPI **_n_**)
- Compute Geometry Image (of size **_im_**) from the parameterized representation (--m2G **_im_**)
- Remesh point cloud from Geometry Image (--G2o)

### Part II: Learning Shapes
python based functionality which contains:
- generating curvature mask from normalGI
- tensorflow model
- docker image
- python scripts to train and test the model
- trained airplane and car models (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3lkfj03c1kmbs8u/AAAnbvxsarmWJ9fkiB4CtREra?dl=0)
